# Birthday-Card

One of my best friend, Santosh had birthday, so I made a Birthday Card, in which I have shown a person with his qualities that sums up to that person and that's a very cool thing, I think. And as this is the birhtday card, there is obviously, I am going to write happy birthday to you with some dynamic changes. Here, I am using tools like, figma, html, css and javascript.
